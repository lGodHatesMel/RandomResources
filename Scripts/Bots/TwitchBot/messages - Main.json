This will allow you to select any Pokemon that is possible to be added to the raids (for now, please use `Violet 3 - 5 Star`). Once you find a Pokemon you want to add, you will need the ID from the first column that is beside the Pokemon you want. Once you have the Pokemon you want, use the command `2addraid ID` and it will be added to the list for you. Happy Raiding!",
